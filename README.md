# [trending!](https://nsanaie.github.io/higherlower-trending/)

## Description

trending! is a "higher or lower" parody game where users can attempt to reach new high scores by guessing which youtube video is higher on the trending charts. The frontend of the app is built using the React framework with JavaScript and the backend is built with Node.js for the loader and Spring boot for the leaderboard data (currently rolled back, database issues)
